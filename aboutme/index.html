    <h2>Lauren Allred</h2>
    <p> Hi my name is Lauren Allred. My major is Applied Technology. I have been studying Web Dev 
        off  and on over the years. I am mom to 4 kids and my hubby and I are celebrating our 22nd 
        anniversary this August. I am a very big fan of Harry Potter, Marvel, reading, taking pictures
        and playing any Mario game on my Switch. Looking forward to learning new things and getting to
         know everyone!  </p>
